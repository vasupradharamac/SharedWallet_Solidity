# SharedWallet_Solidity

This "SharedWallet" is an application to provide allowance using Ethereum blockchain. This application was built using Remix - an Ethereum IDE. The version of Solidity used for this application is 0.8.1 hence the SafeMath library which was used in the previous versions of Solidity need not be used here. 
This application holds two smart contracts with which the user(Owner) can provide allowance to another user using their wallet address. Also, in this particular smart contract, the new owner cannot be created (for additional security purposes).
